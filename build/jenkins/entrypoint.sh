# Jenkins entrypoint. Stages the per-player flag into the directory JCasC reads file secrets from
# ($SECRETS), so the `flag` credential resolves at boot — WITHOUT the flag ever being an image layer,
# a spec value or a process environment variable (a pipeline must bind the credential to read it, and
# only the poisoned artifact run prints it, which is the whole point of the challenge).
#
# Isoloom mounts the per-player input as a read-only file at /run/lab/secrets/flag. When it is empty
# (an offline start — local, CI) the inert development placeholder is staged instead, so the lab
# still comes up and is solvable.
